 <div id='about-text'> 
  <p>
      I am a Product Manager from Jamaica who currently resides in South Florida.
      I have an extensive background in education having graduated with a Master's Degree in Educational Leadership in 2018. 
  </p> 
  <p>
      I enjoy opportunities that allow me to leverage my love for learning and creating engaging user experiences. I have working knowledge of several programming languages including, ruby, ruby on rails,javascript, and python. Much of my daily workflow includes refining product backlogs, whiteboarding, prioritizing and developing usecase concepts.
  </p> 
  <p>
      This allows me to use several of my strengths including communication, technical drawing, and strategy. I enjoy working with groups and believe team work makes the dream work. I am a certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) and Scrum Master (PSM).
